# Learning LangChain

This repository documents my journey learning LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## What I've Learned
- Working with different language models
- Creating and managing prompt templates
- Building basic chains for text processing
- Built runnables class abstraction from scratch
- How Diffrent Document Loaders work together
- Used chroma and faiss vector stores to store embeddings
- and finally retrieved those vectors from the vector store

## Completed Topics
- Models (LLMs and Chat Models)
- Prompt Templates
- Chains
- Runnables
- Document Loaders
- Vector Stores
- Retrievers

## Resources
- [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html)
- [LangChain GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my learning journey!
